# DOM and Events
### Given HTML, use DOM manipulation and event listeners to transform it into a working accordion

Create an accordion such that on click of the button, it will toggle the accordion and the ARROW svg will show if the accordion is open or closed.

##### Some clues
- Is there **another way** we can access the element aside from *document.getElementById*?
- What can I use to add the ARROW next to the button, or even **adjacent** to it?
- How can I toggle **active** class, or how can I show **active** if open and *disappears* when closed?
